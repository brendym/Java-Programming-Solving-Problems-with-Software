# Java-Programming-Solving-Problems-with-Software
Solutions to coding assignments from the Java-Programming-Solving-Problems-with-Software online Coursera course from Duke University

IMPORTANT NOTE:
Some code should be run in a custom Bluej Development Environment made by Duke's University especially for this course. You can get the IDE from the University website here.
